  I generated the HTML page structure by using Emmet in VS Code. Type ! and hit TAB. 
  See the HTML Template page in the Content section of Learning Suite for more info

   BTW - never put a comment before the <!DOCTYPE html> all HTML files MUST 
   begin with that DOCTYPE tag.
  
   Make sure you use the Beautify extension to format your HTML so that it's 
   indented consistently. See "Tools needed for the course" in the content section 
   of Learning Suite.

   And don't forget to validate your page at https://validator.nu/ 
   Select the options "Show image report" which will display image alt text and 
   "Show outline" so you make sure your headers are hierarchical. 
   Make sure you don't have any warnings or errors.

   Finally, if you make changes and re-upload your file, make sure to clear the 
   browser cache with Ctrl-shift-R or Cmd-shift-R so that the changes will show.
   Github tends to run slow in the late afternoon and night when all the programmers
   are awake.

      <h2>Not what they seem</h2>
      <p>The once noble pigeon has been warped and transformed into a sickly, disease-ridden bird that huddles in gray
        masses, scavenging our city streets for discarded chicken bones and soggy french fries. They rummage through
        pungent city trash cans scratching the last bits of spoiled food from discarded takeout containers. They are
        ubiquitous in US cities. But harmless? Think again.</p>

      <!-- you will see an <em> - emphasis tag inside this paragraph. <em> elements are usually 
        displayed in italics, but you can override the display with CSS -->
      <p>Consider this: <em>have you ever seen a baby pigeon?</em> Isn't that enough to convince you that something
        nefarious is going on?</p>

      <h2>Deep state operatives</h2>
      <p>Pigeons are working as biotech spies for the government. Loaded with surveillance technology, the pigeons spy
        on the public, collecting your private data and transmitting it directly to the DSIA &ndash; the secret Deep
        State Intelligence Agency inside the CIA.</p>

      <p>Our army of patriot hackers intercepted CIA emails. The level of deceit by our government is without precedent.

      <!-- here is my figure. Notice the placement of figcaption -->
      <figure>
        <!-- since we haven't covered directories, upload your image with your index.html
          Eventually you will need to move all images to an images/ subdirectory, so if you
          know to do that, go ahead.
          
          In early web dev, everyone added image width and height because images downloaded
          slowly and they wanted the browser to reserve a space for the image so the text didn't
          "jump" when the image arrived (you can see this jump on mobile sites that take forever
          to load ads -- ad companies are the worst at writing code). As responsive sites
          became popular, they stopped using height and width in the HTML. The pendulum has
          swung back and developers are adding height and width again to the HTML to clue 
          the browser to the image aspect ratio. NEVER use height and width in HTML to 
          resize an image. Use the exact image height and width.

          ALSO: NO SPACES IN IMAGE NAMES. THE WEB DOESN'T LIKE SPACES; IT PREFERS %20 in URLs which causes problems.

    <h2>Tips for encounters</h2>
    <p>If you happen upon a pigeon, we recommend you take the following steps to protect yourself and your privacy:</p>

    <!-- an <ol> is an ordered list. It will display numbered list items -->
    <ol>
      <li>Fill your pockets with spoiled food and/or roll around in week-old garbage. We recommend dumpster diving at
        restaurants that predominantly serve chicken, such as Popeye's or KFC</li>
      <li>Find a lone pigeon and slowly approach it</li>

      <!-- notice how the nested list is inside an <li>. A <ul> or <ol> can only have <li> as direct 
        children. If you have another <ul> at the same level as an <li>, you will receive a validator 
          error. This is the correct way to nest lists  -->
      <li>Assert dominance over the bird
        <ul>
          <li>Maintain eye contact with the bird at all times</li>
          <li>Never turn your back on it</li>
          <li>Stand tall with your shoulders back</li>

          <!--the <li> below has a <strong> element. <strong> elements are usually display as bold text, 
            but like <em>, the display can be overridden with CSS -->
          <li>Bob your head back and forth &ndash; <strong>this is key to pigeon dominance</strong></li>
          <li>As you approach the bird, repeat "coo coo ca-choo" &ndash; a little louder each repeat &ndash; to show the
            bird you are not only an equal, but a superior <em>(you might want to practice these noises and the head
              bobbing before you encounter a pigeon &ndash; find our instructional videos on YouTube)</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Once you are within two feet of the bird, yell, as loudly as possible, <strong>"I know your secret. You are a
          deep state drone. You cannot take my freedoms from me."</strong></li>
    </ol>

  <!-- notice that the header, main, aside, and footer are all on the same level. If you open the
